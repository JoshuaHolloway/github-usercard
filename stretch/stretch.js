// Stretch Goals
// Instead of manually creating a list of followers, do it programmatically. Create a function that requests the followers data from the API after it has received your data and create a card for each of your followers. Hint: you can chain promises.

// Look into adding more info as an expanding card. You will need to create some new CSS and a button that expands and contracts the card.

// Look into adding your GitHub contribution graph. There are a number of different ways of doing this, this Stack Overflow discussion will get you started.

const card = document.querySelector('.card');
console.log(card);
